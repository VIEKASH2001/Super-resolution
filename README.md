# OCT-Super-Resolution

Welcome to the README page for "CLEARNESS: Cross-scaLe tEmporAl gRaph NEtwork for Super-reSolutions"! This is a research project focused on developing a novel approach to medical image super-resolution. Our proposed method utilizes a cross-scale neighbor aggregative graph topology with temporal coherence regularization and laplacian constrained convolution kernels (posterior sharpening) to achieve state-of-the-art results.

In our manuscript, which is currently under preparation, we present our methodology in detail, along with the experimental results we obtained. Our approach achieved a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 31.19 and a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 92.33 for an 8x resolution boost, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods.

Stay tuned for more updates on our manuscript and further developments in our research!
